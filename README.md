First stage is quite large and expensive Unlike other rocket providers, SpaceX's Falcon 9 can recover the first stage Sometimes the first stage does not land Sometimes it will crash. Other times, SpaceX will sacrifice the first stage due to mission parameters like payload, orbit and customer By this feature SpaceX charges is cheaper than other providers(approximately 1/3 of their cost) because they reuse first stage which price is 60%-70% of the price of rocket.
